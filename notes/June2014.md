# pH Detection questions:
1. Why not use a [standard meter](http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/plants/management/joysmanual/4ph.html)?
	- i.e. what is the benefit for using the silicon nanowire? 
2. Has this been [done before](http://www.vantixdx.com/technology/)
	- The idea must be to create a general infrastructure, but isn't measuring pH a well-trod path?
		- Why would we create a complicated method to measure pH when simpler devices exist?
