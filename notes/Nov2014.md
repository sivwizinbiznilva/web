#November Notes!

###My EE understanding of conductivity (in metals)
[Electronic Band Structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_band_structure) are ranges of energy that an electron may have (energy bands like valence and conductance bands) or may not have (band gaps). This implies that electrons cannot take on any arbitrary energy value because quantum mechanics. Electrons will fill energy bands from the lowest up because Pauli exclusion principle. <p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bandgap_in_semiconductor.svg#mediaviewer/File:Bandgap_in_semiconductor.svg"><img alt="Bandgap in semiconductor.svg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Bandgap_in_semiconductor.svg" height="480" width="282"></a><br>"<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bandgap_in_semiconductor.svg#mediaviewer/File:Bandgap_in_semiconductor.svg">Bandgap in semiconductor</a>" by <a href="//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pieter_Kuiper" title="User:Pieter Kuiper">Pieter Kuiper</a> - <span class="int-own-work">Own work</span>.

[Fermi Level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_level) is the energy level up to which the electrons have filled. In metals electric conduction happens when an electron jumps from the valence band to the conduction band and the [empty seat in an auditorium analogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole#Simplified_analogy:_Empty_seat_in_an_auditorium) applies. Unfortunately this analogy may not apply to conductivity in an electrolytic.

###[Electrolytic conductivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductivity_(electrolytic)
Measures a solution's ability to conduct electricity (i.e. takes into account all ions present in a solution like H+, Na+, Mg+ (Cations) and OH-, Cl-, Acetate- (Anions)), whereas pH only measures the hydrogen ion (H+) activity $pH=-\log_{10} (a_H+)$. Measuring conductivity involves applying an AC voltage to prevent electrolysis (causing a non-spontaneous reaction) and measuring the resistance of the solution between two flat or cylindrical electrodes separated by a fixed distance.

#The Process
- There are two processes we can consider for engineering bioelectronics:
 1. The Engineering Method
 2. Complex Systems Design
- The first step in determining which to use is to answer the question: Does the system display *complexity*?
   - [A system will be considered *complex* if it is **impossible** to predict all of its behaviors from the behaviors and relationships of its components](http://www.cvaieee.org/html/resp_citizen/Complex_Systems.pdf)
- The first test we will run to determine if the system is complex is our jar of bacteria containing the most simple bioelectronics project our lab can build
 - If this works **reliably** then it may be acceptable to assume that our subsequent prototype can be designed using the Engineering Method
 - If this doesn't work **reliably** and [*emergent behaviors*](http://www.cvaieee.org/html/resp_citizen/Complex_Systems.pdf) are observed then we may have to revisit our design methodology.
## What is a Complex System?

##Build Artoos not Death Stars
   1. We can create a simpler genetic circuit?
   2. Consider the system *complex*
   3. Do something else
