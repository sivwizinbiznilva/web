# Partial Reconfiguration Workshop

- Benefits of PR
  - Reduce power
  - Avoid multi-chip solutions when resources are limited
- Terms
  - **Fixed Configuration** - Typical config mode
  - **Reconfiguration** - Load a different full device bitstream
  - **Partial Reconfiguration** - Only alter a subset of config data, but all computation haults during modification
  - **Dynamic Reconfigration** - Alter a subset of config data, but logic layer continues operating
- Synthesis
  - For PR, you must synthesize bottom-up, which does not allow optimization across reconfigurable modules (RM)

## Vivado Design Flow
- vivado.jou - Contains just the Tcl commands executed by the vivado ide

## Lab 1
- You cannot have two reconfigurable partitions above or below each other in the same clock region
> Partial bitstreams by constrution are the height of a full clock region

## PR Design Considerations
- Keep interactions between modules simple
- You will not get away with playing clock games!
  - Only use one clock, one edge (all rising or falling)
  - D-type ffs
- Register behavioral block outputs
- Do not use constants as inputs to a partition
- Combinatorial logic will not be combined across partition boundaries
  - REGISTER ALL OUTPUTS AND INPUTS
    - Register outputs of RM in static logic since RM will not output valid data until PR is complete
- No global set/reset function for PR
- Each RM destined to fit in a RP must be named the same and posses identical ports!

## PR Controller
- Use ACI Lite if PRC functionality needs to be altered under the software control

## Debugging PR Design
- Actual function of Partial Reconfiguration can't be simulated
  - No model for configuration sequence or ICAP (internal configuration access port)
