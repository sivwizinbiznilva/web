2. Aaron
 - Lab of the **_FUTURE_**
3. Ryan

4. Traci

#Cassie
- Make sure all of your stuff is saved and organized
- Strength of your thesis is end-to-end (perspectus)
- Since you're chopping off the end: you need to gold-plate what you have
 - **What is going to be your ultimate deliverable if not $\mu$F??**
 - How will the deliverable be useful?
 - Change reference point in demo?
 - Make a simulator?

#Aaron
- Data capture is important
- Measure of quality is important
- Simplify biological components and get them to do interesting things in a very controllable way 
- Create a reproducible assay environment
- Do biological computation reliably
- If doing the above two things involves $\mu$F, so be it, if not then let's do it
