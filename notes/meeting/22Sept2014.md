###Ryan
| Item | Due Date |
|:-: | :-: |
| Order more sensors | Friday 26 Sept |

###Cassie
| Item | Due Date |
| :-: | :-: |
| Generate a list of tasks required to consider each milestone complete | **Monday 6 Oct (Meeting)** |

| Begin process of acquiring Voigt plasmids. Talk with Traci and report on progress | **Monday 6 Oct (Meeting)** |
| Create a slideshow of how your board will accomplish the Voigt experiment. The slideshow should be 99% in picture form. | **Monday 6 Oct (Meeting)** |
| Outline demos **very specifically** | **Monday 6 Oct (Meeting)** | 
| Fill in "?"s on the Component Milestones table | **Monday 6 Oct (Meeting)** | 

##Notes

###Aaron
- Your pitch must address TinyOS and any other devices that kind of do what sensorAPI should do
- Must include the API's proposed architecture, preferably addressing each layer of the OSI model.
 - Populate each OSI layer with existing technologies that you will leverage, and annotate the layers in which you will make a novel contribution

###Cassie
Component Milestones:

| Name | Input | Output | Due Date | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\mu$F Netlist Generation | MHDL or Hardcoded | Graph | 7 Oct | What does support for 4, 16, 64 mean? Will you parse MHDL? What is the MHDL toolchain? |
| Placement | Graph | ? | 21 Oct | - |
| Routing | ? | .eps file | 28 Oct | Will map flow and control layers. Infer control mux(?) |
| Biogate Placement | ? | ? | 3 Nov | No optimization, but include error messages |
| Valve Control | ? | ? | 10 Nov | - |
| Valve Simulation | ? | Animated Movie | 17 Nov | - |
| Layout | ? | ? | 8 Dec | Compaction and 2-D |

Demonstrations:

| Date | Description |
| :-: | :-: |
| 3 Nov | Demonstration of toolchain from $\mu$F Netlist Generation to Routing using arbitrary inputs |
| 17 Nov | Animated movie of your chip performing the Voigt experiment |
| 1st January Meeting | Live-action movie of your chip performing the valve sequence simulated on 17 Nov |

Concerns:

- Biogate Placement component seems "Biologically Naive"...too many details to be considered
 - Intermediate chambers?
 - Time to execute?
 - ...
- You need to build your devices in parallel
 - **Your stuff will not work on the first try**
 - Anticipate failure
