Silicon Nanowire notes:
- Need at least 10u liters of fluid, but she uses 40
- Need a reference electrode 1mm in diameter
- Bond pads are 9mm apart
- First step is to acquire a dummy device while processing the mounds of
  paperwork required to actually obtain a device
- She uses an Agilent B1500 to characterize (IV curve) the device. Applies a
  voltage sweep while simultaneously measuring current

Bioelectronics project notes:
- Work will go in the Fluigi section until we dream up an awesome name
- **Action Item**: Dream up an awesome name
- The sensor could pass a signal to the ufluidics controller
- WIRELESSLY TRANSMITTING BACTERIA!!
- **Action Item** Check out Jeff Hasty's oscillator
