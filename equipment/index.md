# Here's what I'm thinking I'll need:

1. Atlas-Scientific pH Kit
 - Why: Interfaces directly with an Arduino! (<--Holy cow!)
 - Price: $105.95
 - Direct Link: https://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/kits/ph-kit.html
2. Alternative pH kit...SO EXPENSIVE
 - Why: ISFET based
 - Price 800 EUR
 - Direct: http://www.sentron.nl/files/5514/0554/8086/pH-kit_rev_02.pdf
2. Filing Cabinet (the one everyone in this office has?)
3. Bookcase (the one everyone in this office has?)
