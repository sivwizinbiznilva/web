##Observation: 
Teams in the hardware track are **at least** half wetlab and **at most** half hardware (observation derived from looking at team attributions)

##My concern: 
We are USTC with significantly less students and significantly less access to biology

##Risk: 
With the manpower/resources we have, we have no reason to expect better results than USTC
