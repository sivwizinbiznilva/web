<p>Revolutions in technology require both a broad range of different types of component and subsystem, and their integration into complete, functional systems. The field of microfluidics is in early adolescence and still lacks both these essential requirements, in addition to the integration of components into systems that can be used by non-experts. As a field, it is a combination of unlimited promise, pimples and incomplete commitment. This is a very exciting time for the field, but we still do not know exactly what it will be when it grows up.</p>

<p>Given sufficient measurements, one should be able to formulate a mathematical model that accurately predicts receptor outputs for input signals that have not been tested. Because the only purpose of the model is to predict receptor I/O, a black-box model will typically be preferred over a more complicated version reflecting the receptor molecular biology. Once it is parameterized with experimental data, the model can be used to simulate the receptor response to a wide range of different inputs in silico, thus enabling the computational design of effector signals capable of driving biological signals with desired quantitative and temporal features and satisfying challenge two. Additionally, if receptor outputs can be measured using fluorescent proteins in real time, an in silico feedback controller can adjust the designed input signal to account for any deviations from the model prediction</p>

<p>The fact that cooperation is simultaneously ubiquitous and fragile, begs for an explanation regarding its emergence and maintenance.<br>E. coli bacteria collectively restrain growth to avoid population collapse when resources become scarce [21]b [23]. The collective decision to restrain growth before all resources are depleted is a form of altruistic cooperation, and one can think of the entry into stationary phase as a social contract: a collective rule of density-dependent growth regulation [9], [24]. The long-term benefits of going into stationary phase are evident: by limiting population growth, bacteria ensure that enough resources will be available to maintain a viable population for an extended period, and survive until conditions improve and growth can be resumed. In the short term however, b cheaterb  cells that ignore the collective decision to restrain growth and that utilize the scarce resources to proliferate instead of investing in maintenance, may increase in numbers. As a result, cheaters jeopardize the survival of the collective b  which in turn could face a tragedy of the commons [25].<br>In a Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma, the Sucker&#39;s payout is negative for their model (only look at the sign of the payoff differences) to work; in a Snowdrift regime the Sucker&#39;s payout is positive). </p>

<li><strong>Does TweeColi offer a novel method of conducting co-culture experiments?</strong><blockquote>
<p>As population interactions suffer from context dependency and can change in different environments, characterization should include stress limits. For example, an engineered interaction was reported to be functional only within certain pH ranges [39]. Taking context dependency into account does not imply a departure from the engineering and computing analogy on which synthetic biology is based, but rather an improved appreciation of the challenges that come with the analogy. Just as civil engineers need to consider the environmental stresses that a building will have to withstand, synthetic biologists need to consider the working environment of bio-parts at the stage of circuit design. On the other hand, co-culture technologies can support the genetic engineering that is at the basis of synthetic systems. Genetic programming cannot entirely predict cellular behaviour, as environment plays a role and there are still limits in what can be controlled genetically [41]. Using genetic engineering and controlled environmental conditions through experimental set-up together could allow a level of population control that was previously thought impossible. Emergent and unpredicted behaviour can arise in co-cultures and may or may not be desired. One important question in the choice of cultivation technology is what properties of the natural populations are to be preserved or suppressed. Overall, populations can be controlled genetically and through the environment. Which aspects can be controlled genetically or through set-up is a subject of ongoing research.</p>

<p>It is nonetheless reasonable to place synthetic biology towards one end of a continuum between purely b blindb  processes of organic modification at one extreme, and wholly rational, design-led processes at the other. </p>
<ul>
<li>Irrational:<br>They are b irrationalb  only because the agent who oversees the process need not understand why the resultant entity works as it does. Whether a method is b rationalb  or b irrationalb  is itself something that comes by degrees: an engineer may not understand why the parts of a machine work as they do, but he may still be able to predict in rough-and-ready ways how they will behave when brought together. After several moderately successful attempts he may be surprised at the makeup of the machine that works best.</li>

<li>Nazi attempt to breed back aurochs failed because<blockquote>
<p>On the basis of vague criteria and without proper knowledge of the appearance of the aurochs, the two brothers made inaccurate selections among the crossbreeding products of various cattle breeds. They did not use the knowledge about the aurochs that was available at the time, nor did they take advantage of the breeding techniques others were using to create new cattle breeds in the same period. (Van Vuure, 2005, p. 366)<br><strong>Poor engineering design methodology</strong></p>

<li>With regard to directed evolution, &#39;the creativity of synthetic biology itself continues to rely on processes whose efficacy may be inscrutable to the designers themselves, and which have much in common with familiar breeding techniques&#39;</li>
<li>Irrational design in &#39;evolutionary electronics&#39;<ul>
<li>An FPGA was altered slightly and continuously tested for an ability to do a task and the best design could never have been achieved using normal design techniques<blockquote>
<p>[These cells] cannot be clamped [i.e. returned to their default b blankb  state] without degrading performance, even though there is no connected path by which they could influence the output b &amp; They must be influencing the rest of the circuit by some means other than the normal cell-to-cell wires: this probably takes the form of a very localised interaction with immediately neighbouring components. Possible mechanisms include interaction through the power-supply wiring, or electromagnetic coupling. ( Thompson, 2002)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reducible complexity is not an artifact of evolution (T. Lewens 2004), therefore we should not expect to isolate components and then stick them together in a different order and expect rational behavior<blockquote>
<p>Evolution has been free to explore the full repertoire of behaviours available from the silicon resources provided, even being able to exploit the subtle interactions between adjacent components that are not directly connected. (Thompson, 2002)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Does natural selection prefer modularity? Will it pick a modular design vs a non-modular design?</strong><blockquote>
<p>It remains unclear whether natural selection is able to favour modularity<br>Natural selection is not constrained by a prior methodological commitment to rationality, and since natural selection must build traits that are effective in the face of regular internal and external insults, natural selection also needs to ensure that its products are robust against a range of environmental perturbations</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Abandon the idea of modularity in synthetic biology?<blockquote>
<p>Biological complexity is here acknowledged, the barriers it presents to human intervention are explicitly admitted, and attempts are made to avoid it (in the first instance, at least) via the creation of simpler systems.</p>

<li><p>Amazing questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the aspirations of synthetic biology are oft en judged in these terms Can the &#39;synthesis&#39; of biological structures or processes proceed in a planned, deliberate, theory - and evidence - based manner such that the intended outcome is sues as if from a blueprint (Giese et al. 2013, Ob Malley 2009 , Gramelsberger 2013 , Lewens 2013 ) ? And , if this is not the case , is this only b not yet b  the case, likely to become possible in just a few more years , or does it owe to a disc iplinary style of doing things b  with chemists seeking rational control while bioengineers are more comfortable with tinkering ? Or does the failure of rational design owe to a limit of biological complexity that is irreducible and thus an insurmountable limit of control?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Author&#39;s assertion: &quot;The hierarchical conception that places rational engineering above tinkering is blind to the possibility of rational tinkering&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>Engineering may be opposed to &quot;blind groping&quot; but not search strategies that exploit random variations or iterative adaption and tuning.<blockquote>
<p>These, to be sure, are rational strategies by which to work around limits of knowledge, and to achieve technical solutions in the absence of information about mechanical detail. <strong>In other words, these are rational strategies to create robust black boxes or modules</strong></p>

<p>Thus one finds that a predictively successful simulation model can be nearly as complex and just as intractable as the b naturalb  system that is modeled by it(see, e.g., Lenhard/Winsberg 2010).This is a technical achievement by rational means.

<li>Systems Biology vs Synthetic Biology<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design vs Evolution...uh oh!<blockquote>
<p>While anti-Darwinian theories of intelligent design are in ill-repute, how can synthetic biology speak of design processes and simultaneously take the insights of evolutionary biology into account?...conceiving the same biological entity at one time as an object of design (as far as that will go), and at another time as an object of evolution (to the extent necessary), synthetic biologists are tending to the boundary between organism and artifact even as they appear to undermine or even reject it.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the aim of SynBio?  <ul>
<li>Mimic biology? If so, then &quot;artificial selection&quot; is present instead of &quot;natural selection&quot;. i.e. the divices have a purpose, which is not allowed in natural selection and not supported by evolutionary history</li>
<li>Reproduce the work of natural evolution in a purposeful manner? Author asserts that this notion seems troubled by &quot;techonolgical hubris&quot; and accusations of &quot;playing God&quot;, but it can be a sound notion if you treat &quot;nature&quot; as the engineer subject to its own laws.<br>&quot;If there are laws of nature, we can&#39;t violate them anyhow, and in the meantime, it is our job to push the limits of tehcnical possibility&quot;<br>The very question s of how biological engineering should be related to natural history, or of how ev oluti on by natural selection differs from the design of b iological artifacts thus depend on our conception of synthetic biology b  is it an intellectual enterprise with at least some theoretical ambitions or should one judge its attempt to advance unde rstanding of biological systems only in engineering terms ? Only in the former case does the problem arise of having to reconcile the competing ideas of evolution and design , while in the latter case it is merely a practical challenge to insulate as far as possible t he construction of biological entities and processes from the vagaries of evolutionary influence. This fault line between synthetic biolog y as somewhat theory - oriente d and as exclusively engineering - oriented also separates the two ways of paraphras ing Fey nmanb s dictum as well as the two conceptions of rational engineering. It is the fault line that runs between science and technoscience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I take issue with the statement that if synbio is viewed &quot;only in engineering terms&quot; then one does not have to &quot;reconcile the competing ideas of evolution and design&quot;. What if part of the engineering process requires knowing how the original system came to be in order to further modify it, as in complex system design? <ul>
<li>I think it&#39;s a copout to assume that engineers can assume away issues that may be relevent to design because they don&#39;t have &quot;theoretical ambitions&quot;</li>
<li>What happens when design (synbio) meets evolution (wild-type organisms). The author asserts this consideration should enter at the beginning of design &quot;in reflections on the rhyme and reason of naturally evolved biological complexity&quot;. Doesn&#39;t &quot;rhyme and reason&quot; imply a purpose</li>

<li>Normative implications of historical accounts, &quot;suggesting what synthetic biology ought to be and what opportunities and risks it poses, what obligations and expectations come with it&quot;</li>
<li>Is synbio an intellectual paradigm-shift from systems biology that revolves around systems-thinking to understand complexity (synbio is applied systems bio) or is it a means of generating higher complexity by treating systems as more or less efficient units of technical functioning?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Synbio is the application of systems bio<ul>

<li><strong>SUMMATION OF SYSTEMS THINKING VS TECH OPPORTUNITY (scientific vs technoscientific)</strong><blockquote>
<p>To put it a bit metaphorically, then, in relation to systems biology , the two stories about synthetic biology do not attribute to the researchers different theories, opinions , or beliefs but an entirely different mind - set , a different way of living the laboratory life, of participating in history and relating to the tradition of science and the Enlightenment. On the one hand, t here is the scientific mind - set of those who query the limits of reductionism and embrace systems thinking ; on the other hand is the technoscientific mind - set of those who no longer seek the most appropriate way of reducing complexity and promoting intellectual understanding , but who proceed instead to generate biological complexity from available theories and techniques.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Conflict<ul>
<li>Researchers may work using both methods, but within publications they only demonstrate one way of thinking</li>

<li><strong>Summary</strong>: Only chance for synbio to succeed is by way of design processes that can acoommodate or work around ignorance<ul>
<li>Nature published an editorial on the 10th anniversary of the repressilator and a switchable regulartory network and say that these &quot;contributions to and from basic science are part of synthetic biology that most deserves celebration&quot;<ul>
<li>Does this mean synbio is a basic science? an applied science? if applied science then:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;in which sense...is the design of the repressilator an &#39;experiment&#39;&quot;?</li>
<li>Is &quot;to understand something one must build it&quot; really a principle of physics as a basic science?</li>
<li>How and when is &quot;to design&quot; the same thing as &quot;to define&quot;?</li>
<li>How is the ability to create a computer model the same as human knowledge, ex. theories that are tractable by the human mind<ul>
<li>Remember that the quote is &quot;What I cannot create, I do not understand&quot; not &quot;What I can create, I do understand&quot;, which implies that &quot;understanding&quot; can leap ahead of explanation and prediction</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>The rest of the paper was highlighting discontinuous differences between design by Random Evolution, Directed Evolution and Comginatorial Design</li>
<li>Design by Random Evolution (evolutionary design) is an oxymoronic misnomer...see intelligent design</li>
<li>The picture implies further development of combinatorial design strategies will produce knowledge required for progression to rational design</li>
<li>Rational design is assumed to be more effective than evolutionary design...why is that? because it&#39;s &quot;rational&quot;, or knowledge based? The authors admit that it&#39;s just a hypothesis that needs to be tested.</li>
<li>The figure paints an ambivalent picture: the knowledge required is too great so a new trajectory is needed that bypasses the prohibitively high knowledge requirement, or the picture cheerfully tells a story of progress and a sequence of steps towards the ultimate goal of rational design</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tabor advocates creating things through a kind of technical probing and then passing the information on to systems biologists for hypothesis generation and testing<blockquote>
<p> b As automated circuit design and assembly dovetails with iterative optimization, our ability to engineer circuits should extend beyond our ability to truly understand how they work. The tractability of modularly constructed synthetic circuits, however, should also feed back to accelerate the cycle of hypothesis generation and testing in systems biology.b  (Tabor 2012, 1063)</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabor&#39;s process:<br>Tabor offers an epistemologically telling description of the design - cycle approach: b Here, the first design is based on the ligand - inhibited repressors LacI and TetR. Each is initially placed upstream of an associated fluorescent reporter on a polycistronic mRNA. The operons show poor reporter expression, which is then imp roved by b plugging inb  additional copies of the appropriate promoter upstream of each reporter. This increases reporter expression, but reveals that the circuit cannot reach the TetR - dominated state. The tetR promoter is then swapped for a stronger version , but this overcompensates for the problem making only the TetR state stable. A library of random tetR ribosome binding sites (RBSs) is then screened, and a variant that hits the bistable sweet spot is found b  (Tabor 2012, 1063, compare Litcofsky et al. 2012)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The author takes Tabor as saying that computers, rather than humans, will &quot;understand&quot; the organizing principles of life, which the author argues &quot;leaves untouched the break with the epistemic values and traditional ideals of science&quot;<ul>
<li>The matter of definition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Synthetic biology is not analytic because it generates rather than reduces complexity</li>
<li>The author&#39;s definition of synbio:<blockquote>
<p>This, then, suggests a definition of synthetic biology that highlights its specific epistemic values and ideals: For constructive purposes synthetic biology builds on the achievement in silico, in vitro, and in vivo of technical control of biological complexity, that is, it is the endeavor of drawing together de facto achievements of technical control for the generation of technical systems with greater biological complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>The tension between an engineering approach and the quest for understanding biological processes cannot be resolved by simply stating that synbio can do both<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is quite impossible to simply marry the epistemic ideals of technoscientific synthetic biology to those of biology as a theoretical science - they pull in opposite directions, after all: Here the reduction of complexity for the purposes of intellectual tractability, there the drawing together of scientific knowledge and technological capability for the generation of complexity beyond our ability to truly understand how our own creations work. Here the identification of bottle-necks and needs- to-know for rational engineering, along with the demand for more and better theoretical knowledge in order to diminish ignorance, and there the attempt primarily to discover how much one can achieve even with how little we know, with considerable tolerance for ignorance of everything that can be black-boxed. The tension, even antagonism, between these epistemic ideals cannot be dissolved b  which does not preclude, of course, that the corresponding research findings can inform, even inspire one another.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>YES!<blockquote>
<p>It is not at all impossible, in contrast, to marry the notion of bringing an engineering approach to biology and the notion of knowledge production through synthetic biology b  but in order to do so one might have to become dishabituated from the established scientific image of knowledge and of knowledge production. From the point of view of the engineering approach, knowledge and understanding need not be tied to the intellectual tractability of causal relations, nor does it consist in the truth or falsity, or empirical adequacy of linguistic statements such as theories or hypotheses. Instead, knowledge and understanding might reside in computer models and other technologically robust constructions, tied to the iterations of the design cycle as a learning process of sorts.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>YES YES! From the Nature editorial:<blockquote>
<p>As it develops along this and other paths, synthetic biology itself will demand more by way of new fundamental biological knowledge b  quantitative, systematic, computational and biophysical. And conversely, one of the deepest lessons from these first ten years is that biological knowledge will require synthetic approaches if it is to become a mature and reasonably predictive science.

<li>Contribution: usually HTHs are the result of &quot;malicious &#39;insider&#39; parties in the design or manufacturing&quot; phases. FPGAs open the door for the insertion of HTHs after a circuit has been vetted for traditional HTHs, i.e. no validation method currently exists for DPR HTHs</li>

<li>Section I - Intro<ul>
<li>HDLs are ubiquitous <ul>
<li>Until recently HLS tools have been cost prohibitive and did not integrate with synthesis tools</li>
<li>DSP has really been the only application that widely accepts HLS as an everyday solution</li>
<li>This changed when Xilinx incorporated HLS in Vivado</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outside of DSP, no one has compared hardware synthesized via HLS vs RTL for crypto and network security applications<ul>
<li>Limited research has been conducted that investigated the feasibility of implementing the algorithm via HLS, but does not investigate any performance tradeoffs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The experiment pits an AES implementation written in C and run through HLS, vs handwritten VHDL </li>
<li>The study uses ISE 14.7 and Quartus II 13.0sp1 for Xilinx and Altera FPGAs</li>
<li>FPGAs consisted of one high-performance and one low-cost fpga from each vendor</li>
<li>No vendor-specific IP was used (ex DSP blocks, BRAM, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section II - Methodology<ul>
<li>128-bit AES in Counter Mode (<strong>Need to learn this!</strong>)</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>As our target is AES-CTR, only the encryption mode is supported in the AES-ECB</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What does this mean? Why does AES-CTR only support encryption vs decryption?</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Core module: AES-ECB-ENC (AES-(Electronic Codebook)-Encryption<ul>
<li>Counter mode is &quot;added on top of the AES-ECB-ENC unit&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C Code used was the original reference software implementation of Rjindael<ul>
<li>There exist more specialized C implementations but the paper seeks to perform an analysis on a &quot;typical&quot; software implementation as this research is focused on the HLS process vs AES implementations</li>
<li>The code was modified to remove all infrastructure supporting non-128-bit operations. This design is denoted <em>HLSv0</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The experiment had the following controls:<ul>
<li>Same target HDL (VHDL)</li>
<li>Same FPGA tools (did not use any dedicated FPGA resources)<ul>
<li>ISE Design Suite v14.7</li>
<li>Quartus II v13.0sp1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Same FPGA tool option optimization techniques <ul>
<li>&quot;uniform optimization of FPGA tool options was facilitated by ATHENa [19]&quot;<ul>

<li>Removal of logtables using <em>xtime</em><ul>

<li>since mixcolumns only requires multiplication by $0x02$ and $0x03$ in $GF(2^8)$, you can just use xtime<ul>
