abstract  ="Microfluidic devices{,} by definition{,} are required to move liquids from one physical location to another. Given a finite and frequently fixed set of physical channels to route fluids{,} a primitive design element that allows reconfigurable routing of that fluid from any of n input ports to any n output ports will dramatically change the paradigms by which these chips are designed and applied. Furthermore{,} if these elements are {"}regular{"} regarding their design{,} the programming and fabrication of these elements becomes scalable. This paper presents such a design element called a transposer. We illustrate the design{,} fabrication and operation of a single transposer. We then scale this design to create a programmable fabric towards a general-purpose{,} reconfigurable microfluidic platform analogous to the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) found in digital electronics."}
